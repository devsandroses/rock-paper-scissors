I made it to my first JavaScript project! I am both excited and nervous to tackle this project! The JavaScript fundamentals lessons have been challenging and leave me scratching my head at times. My understanding is a little shakey when it comes to writing JavaScript. I comprehend the logical opeators, conitionals and comparisons and I get what strings, values and functions are. But putting it all together is a difficult endevor. I will for sure be using the problem solving methods that were covered in the previous lesson. I also have been getting tripped up at times with basic syntax, such as omitting a semi colon when there should be one - its all in the little details! Anyways I am looking forward to this challenge and I will add my final thoughts once the project is completed!
Thoughts after completion: Project challenged my understanding of functions, especially scopes. Was tricky to put it all together and I spent sometime on discord and stack overflow sorting out my confusion. There we also several aspects I needed to google, such as the scoring and counting the rounds.
